This repository is used to track my progress through the [CS50](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home/) course by HarvardX.

### About

I am using this space to organize my code, and solutions as I work through the CS50 curriculum.  
This will help me monitor my learning journey and keep all related materials in one place.

### Structure

- **Assignments/**: My solutions to problem sets and assignments.


### Why "yellow duck"?

The name is inspired by the "rubber duck debugging" techniqueâ€”explaining your code or thought process to a duck (or any inanimate object) to find solutions!
